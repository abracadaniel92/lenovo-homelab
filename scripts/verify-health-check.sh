# Verify Health Check Configuration
# Checks that the health check timer is properly configured with 3-minute interval
#
# Status: STALE — the header still references the old 3-minute interval, but
# production has been on a 1-hour interval since fix-health-check-timer.sh ran.
# Prefer scripts/verify-health-check-interval.sh for current verification, or
# update this script's expectations before relying on it.
