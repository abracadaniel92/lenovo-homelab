# Troubleshooting Log Guidelines

## Purpose
The `TROUBLESHOOTING_LOG.md` is not just for problems - it's a **learning diary** for the entire homelab infrastructure.

## What to Log

### 1. **Issues & Fixes** ✅
- Problems encountered and their solutions
- Root cause analysis
- Steps taken to resolve

### 2. **Successful Projects** ✅
- New services deployed
- Major configuration changes
- System improvements and optimizations

### 3. **Lessons Learned** ✅
- What worked well
- What didn't work
- Best practices discovered
- Mistakes to avoid in the future

### 4. **Configuration Changes** ✅
- Infrastructure modifications
- Network changes
- Security updates

## Entry Format

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD] Descriptive Title

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Action:** What was done
**Result:** Outcome of the action

### 🔍 Root Cause / Background (if applicable)
- Why this was needed
- What led to this change

### ✅ Solution Applied / Implementation
1. Step-by-step what was done
2. Commands run
3. Files modified

### 🧪 Verification
- How success was verified
- Test results

### 📝 Lessons Learned / Key Takeaways
- Important insights
- Best practices
- What to remember for next time

### 📍 Files Involved
- List of files created/modified

**Status**: ✅ Status description
```

## Best Practices

1. **Log Immediately**: Write entries while the work is fresh in your mind
2. **Be Detailed**: Include enough context that you'll understand it 6 months later
3. **Include Commands**: Actual commands run are valuable for future reference
4. **Document Mistakes**: Failed approaches are learning opportunities
5. **Success Stories**: Document what worked well, not just what broke
6. **Cross-Reference**: Link to related issues or documentation

## Remember

> "The best time to document is now. Your future self will thank you."

This log is a **knowledge base** - treat it as a valuable resource for understanding your infrastructure's evolution and learning from past experiences.
