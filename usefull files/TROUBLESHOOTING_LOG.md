# Troubleshooting Log & Known Issues

This log documents specific issues encountered on the server and their fixes.

## [2026-01-04] Service Down (502 Errors) after System Freeze

**Symptoms:**
- All services accessible internally and directly via Caddy.
- External access via Cloudflare Tunnel returning intermittent 502 errors (approx. 60% failure rate).
- Bookmarks service returning 502 permanently.

### Issue 1: Cloudflare Tunnel Instability
**Root Cause:**
- Multiple `cloudflared` replicas (2) running on host network were creating too many connections (8 total).
- UDP buffer sizes were too small (`net.core.wmem_max = 212992`), causing connection drops under load/instability.
- Logs showed: `ERR Request failed error="Incoming request ended abruptly: context canceled"`

**Fix:**
- Increased UDP buffer sizes to 8MB.
- Command: `sudo sysctl -w net.core.wmem_max=8388608`
- Persistence: Added `net.core.wmem_max=8388608` to `/etc/sysctl.d/99-cloudflared.conf`.

### Issue 2: Bookmarks Service (Flask) Port Conflict
**Root Cause:**
- `shairport-sync` (AirPlay receiver) was starting on boot and claiming port **5000**.
- The Flask bookmarks service tries to bind to port 5000 and crashes if it's taken.
- Health check system didn't resolve this because it only checked if service was "active" (and crash-looping counts as activating).

**Fix:**
- Identified conflict using `sudo lsof -i :5000`.
- Disabled unused AirPlay service: `sudo systemctl disable --now shairport-sync`.
- Updated `enhanced-health-check.sh` to specifically check for port 5000 conflicts and kill unauthorized processes.

## General Recovery Commands

If 502 errors return, run the cleanup/recovery script:
```bash
bash "/home/goce/Desktop/Cursor projects/Pi-version-control/restart services/fix-external-access.sh"
```
